Setting up this blog has been on my to-do list for more than a year. It's long overdue, but I'm extremely excited that we finally have our own engineering blog.

[BetterWorks](http://betterworks.com) was founded two years ago with big ambitions. I wanted to improve the way companies operate, bring a new level of transparency to our work lives, and most importantly, I wanted to create an environment where our team can learn and thrive. As hackers, we are born to face bigger challenges and build better products.

Over the last two years, we've accumulated various technical and non-technical wisdoms building and operating our enterprise platform. We want to share some of our learnings here with the rest of the community.

Let's all get 1% better every day.
